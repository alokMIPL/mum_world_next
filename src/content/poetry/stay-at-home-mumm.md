Stay at Home Mum<br>
The house is a mess<br>
My clothes are old<br>
The chores are endless<br>
As the day unfolds<br>
Guilt is a feeling<br>
I’ve grown to know<br>
It follows me daily<br>
Like a dismal shadow<br>
Aches and pains<br>
and all the strains<br>
Bending and lifting<br>
and playing games<br>
Stay at home mum<br>
Won’t that be fun<br>
Finger painting and Netflix<br>
and one on one<br>
“No more work for you”, they’d say<br>
“Free to relax and play all day”<br>
Naive is a word<br>
Not a strong enough fit<br>
To describe this exhaustion<br>
That fills every bit<br>
My back is sore<br>
My hands are dry<br>
My lunch will be crusts<br>
My outlet, a cry<br>
I’m working on forgiveness<br>
I’m working on myself<br>
I’m trying to locate her<br>
high up on a shelf<br>
I’m in the best company<br>
But still I feel lonely<br>
These windows grew bars<br>
For somewhere so homely<br>
I’m juggling many balls<br>
But that’s not the worst<br>
Ones about to drop<br>
Which one will fall first<br>
I hate asking for help<br>
Don’t you see, I can do this<br>
But I need it some days<br>
When it all feels so useless<br>
Rewards and woes<br>
The highs and the lows<br>
Unconditional love<br>
and that’s how it goes<br>
Feelings drifting<br>
So hard to pin down<br>
Some days you win<br>
Others you drown<br>
Yes I am lucky<br>
I love them to bits<br>
and I’d do it again<br>
Every day for these kids<br>
They’ve helped me slow down<br>
They’ve taught me to say No<br>
They’re teaching me daily<br>
about how I can grow.<br>
I’m better because of them<br>
I’ll continue to be<br>
A love like no other<br>
As they are for me<br>
We’re stay at home Mums<br>
We’re bloody strong<br>
So we keep on<br>
Keeping on.<br>
