THAT FIRST YEAR <br>
The year that two became three<br>
No. More. Hot. Tea. <br>
<br>
The year of not leaving your side<br>
For more than an hour<br>
And feeling revived<br>
From a two minute shower <br>
<br>
The year of white noise<br>
Cuddles and baby slings<br>
As you slowly adjust<br>
To the outside things <br>
<br>
The year of sleep regressions<br>
Monkey impressions<br>
Panicked Google searches<br>
Too many to mention <br>
<br>
The year I realised that women<br>
Really do hold all the powers<br>
Rocking and pacing<br>
For hours and hours <br>
<br>
Being more selective of<br>
The company I keep<br>
And dreading that question<br>
So how does he sleep? <br>
<br>
The year of building<br>
All the rods for my own back<br>
Binning the baby books<br>
And not looking back <br>
<br>
Endless walks with the pram<br>
To help you to nap<br>
Pounding the pavements<br>
Looking like crap <br>
<br>
One whole year to realise<br>
That there's no wrong or right<br>
There's what works<br>
What you need<br>
In the middle of the night <br>
<br>
The year of doubts and fears<br>
And bending the ears<br>
Of family and friends<br>
He'll sleep eventually<br>
But when? <br>
<br>
But you're more than<br>
Your sleep struggles<br>
So much more <br>
<br>
You're that look of wonder<br>
At a knock on the door<br>
Your giggles<br>
Your protests<br>
And that tiny roar <br>
<br>
Beaming with pride<br>
As you take in your stride<br>
Learning to roll, crawl and stand<br>
And wave your wee hand <br>
<br>
A sudden respect for those<br>
Who've done all this before<br>
But with two, with three, with four<br>
Or more <br>
<br>
The year of grand plans and dreams<br>
Of these homemade cuisines<br>
But some days just called<br>
For eggs, chips and beans <br>
<br>
And yet somehow you thrived<br>
And we just about survived<br>
The hourly wake-ups<br>
And some almost-breakups <br>
<br>
You really did shake-up<br>
These two kids
