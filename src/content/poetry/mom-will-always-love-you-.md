_A mom will always love you more—<br>
than your partner,<br>
than your closest friends,<br>
than you love her,<br>
than anyone.<br>
Because those people, yes, they do love you a lot,<br>
maybe even “so much,”<br>
but a mother’s love is incomparable.<br>
Because it’s a different kind of love.<br>
It’s a love that prioritizes your well-being above her own,<br>
a love that's loud and so strong that, at times, she aches,<br>
a love that changes with your needs, but it’s always there.<br>
It’s a love that protects and supports.<br>
Because she fell in love with you when you were just a thought<br>
before she even met you,<br>
before, you were a small baby who fit on her chest.<br>
And that kind of love that loves unconditionally is powerful.<br>
Because no one else in this entire world will love you like that.<br>
So, you can’t love more than a mom,<br>
and you won’t understand until you become one._
