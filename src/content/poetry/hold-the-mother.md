⁣But the mother,⁣<br>
may have gaps in her mind from lack of sleep,⁣<br>
may be mechanical in her motions as she’s healing,⁣<br>
may feel more like a mess than a mother,⁣<br>
may be sitting in bed, crying, feeling overwhelmed in her body and life,⁣<br>
may be full of mom guilt because in her mind, "she's not good enough,"⁣<br>
and she’s bleeding, wincing in pain, swollen and emotional.⁣<br>
⁣<br>
And the mother’s that baby's whole world and needs to be seen, so she doesn't disappear into that postpartum fog.⁣<br>
⁣<br>
So, hold the mother, not the baby.⁣<br>
⁣<br>
A mother agrees that her baby matters more.⁣<br>
But she’s hurting, while she’s the person behind the baby,⁣<br>
in the background, making it all happen:⁣<br>
feeding her baby at all hours,⁣<br>
snuggling her baby close to comfort newborn cries,⁣<br>
and being that baby’s everything.⁣<br>
⁣<br>
So, it’s the mother who needs your love.⁣<br>
⁣<br>
And a mother will remember who held her up.⁣<br>
⁣<br>
So instead of “I’m coming to see the baby,”⁣<br>
try saying, “I’m coming to see you 𝘢𝘯𝘥 meet the baby, too.”⁣<br>
⁣<br>
Because the mother needs to be held more.
