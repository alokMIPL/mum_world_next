Mom is depressed<br>
And no one has noticed<br>
She wants everything to be perfect..<br>
She is hurt from within<br>
And the hormones drive her crazy<br>
Why do some men not help..<br>
Is it because it’s only for women?<br>
Now her life changed..<br>
She has no choice but to do her best<br>
Being a professional, a mother and wife<br>
keeping her body fit as well<br>
Mom is depressed<br>
And no one has noticed<br>
They have gotten used of her tired eyes<br>
Mom is sad<br>
She does not feel happy<br>
Is there something wrong with her?<br>
How selfish it is<br>
Tired all the time<br>
You don't control that stress<br>
WHO SEES THE SOUL OF A WOMAN WITH THE BIRTH OF A CHILD ???<br>
Those are your thoughts<br>
I can hear you Mom<br>
That our heart beats the same.<br>
Mom is depressed<br>
And she doesn't understand why<br>
She does not know that she needs a little while<br>
Rest too<br>
A little while of doing nothing is fine<br>
To hear your inner voice<br>
And strengthen your being<br>
But no permission is given<br>
To look for their spaces<br>
Afraid of not doing it right<br>
Rest mom rest<br>
If you are happy and content<br>
I will be too. "
