### You will need:

- Beetroot Chopped - ½ cup
- Water - ¼ cup

### How to Prepare:

- Wash the beetroot in running water thoroughly.
- Peel the skin off with a peeler, cut them into cubes. (I used a ¼th portion of one big beetroot).
- Transfer the chopped beetroot cubes to the pressure cooker and add ¼ cup of water.
- Pressure cook it for two whistles in medium flame. You can steam cook the beetroots for 10 minutes or until soft. Open the cooker once pressure released.
- Transfer the cooked beetroots to a blender. Grind it to a smooth paste.
- Add the water which is used for cooking to reach the desired consistency while grinding.
- You could also mash it with a potato masher instead of blending.
- Beetroot puree is ready.
