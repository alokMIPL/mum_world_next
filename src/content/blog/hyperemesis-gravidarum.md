Hyperemesis gravidarum is an extreme form of morning sickness that causes vomiting and severe nausea during pregnancy. It can lead to dehydration, weight loss, and electrolyte imbalances.

HG can be extremely debilitating and cause fatigue that lasts for weeks or months.

Many women experience morning sickness (nausea) during pregnancy. This condition is generally harmless. While morning sickness can be quite uncomfortable, it typically goes away within 12 weeks. Morning sickness is mild nausea and vomiting that occurs in early pregnancy.

### Most common Symptoms of Hyperemesis Gravidarum:

- Becoming dehydrated

- Loss of appetite

- Weight loss

- Constipation 

- Feeling light-headed or dizzy

- Feeling nearly constant nausea

- Vomiting more than three or four times per day

### What causes hyperemesis gravidarum?

Almost all women experience some degree of morning sickness during their pregnancy. HG and Morning sickness seem to have a connection to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This is a hormone created during pregnancy by the placenta. Your body produces a large amount of this hormone at a rapid rate early in pregnancy. These levels can continue to rise throughout your pregnancy.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum treatment:

- Your doctor may recommend natural nausea prevention methods, such as vitamin B-6 or ginger.

- Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.

- Try eating smaller, more frequent meals and dry foods, such as crackers.

- Severe cases of HG may require hospitalization.

The good news is that symptoms of HG will disappear after giving birth. However, postpartum recovery may be longer for women with HG.
