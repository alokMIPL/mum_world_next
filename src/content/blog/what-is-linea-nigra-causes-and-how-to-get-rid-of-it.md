### What is Linea Nigra?

Linea nigra is a vertical, dark line on the belly that appears during pregnancy. It typically runs from the navel to the pubic area.The line is usually about 1 centimeter wide and runs from the navel toward the pubic area. In some cases, linea nigra extends above the navel towards the breasts.
Linea nigra is the result of hyperpigmentation, in which some skin cells produce more melanin than normal. Linea nigra is not harmful at all, some expecting mothers are understandably troubled by its development. Fortunately, linea nigra is a natural part of most women’s pregnancy and the condition typically resolves on its own without the need for treatment.

If you are expecting or considering becoming pregnant, here is everything you need to know about linea nigra.

### During Pregnancy Common Types of Hyperpigmentation:

- Darkening of hyperpigmented areas such as nipples, areolae and labia
- Linea Nigra: A dark, vertical line on the belly
- Darkening of birthmarks, moles and freckles
- Melasma: Patches of dark skin on the face

### What Causes Linea Nigra?

During pregnancy, hormonal changes cause skin cells in this area to darken, hence the linea nigra. This line extends vertically from the breast plate down through the navel toward the pubic area.

During pregnancy, an increase in hormones; specifically melanocyte-stimulating hormones, progesterone, and estrogen, cause some skin cells to produce extra melanin, or pigment. After you give birth, these hormonal levels will return to normal, and your linea nigra will slowly fade.

Linea nigra most often appears during the second trimester of pregnancy and often occurs alongside other types of hyperpigmentation, such as melasma or the darkening of areas that are already pigmented, like the nipples, areola and labia.

### When Does The Linea Nigra Appear?

The linea nigra is noticeable from the second trimester and fades away shortly after the birth of your baby. In some women, it may not fade away completely and in some, it may not show up at all during the pregnancy. Some others may start noticing it a little later in the pregnancy. The line usually becomes visible from the fourth or fifth month and expands in width as the belly grows.
The pregnancy line is prominent in women with darker skin compared to those with fairer skin. But does this line mean anything?

### Linea Nigra And The Old Wives Tale:

According to old wives tales, the linea nigra helps to predict the gender of the baby, they said:

- The dark line helps the baby breastfeed by guiding them to the areola. Also, the baby can recognize the areola from the smell, which is similar to the smell of the amniotic fluid that was surrounding the baby.

- If the line runs from the bottom of the rib cage to the pubic bone, it is a boy. If the line runs from the navel to the pubic bone, then its a girl.

***"But, there is no scientific evidence to prove these claims".***

### How Common is Linea Nigra?

During pregnancy, more than 90% of women report changes to their skin. Hyperpigmentation is among the most common of these changes. Nearly 75% of women will experience areas of skin darkening while they are pregnant. Linea nigra is just one type of hyperpigmentation.

### Who is Most Likely to Develop Linea Nigra?

Linea nigra can be more prevalent in those who spend time in the sun, have certain pre-existing conditions such as hyperthyroidism, or have a genetic predisposition to hyperpigmentation.
You’re more likely to develop linea nigra if you already have dark skin. Women with light skin may experience a lighter colored linea nigra because they have less pigment in their skin to begin with.

### Factors that Increase Risk of Linea Nigra are:

- Genetics
- Dark skin
- Thyroid disease
- Hormonal imbalances
- Certain medications

Although it’s much less common, linea nigra can occur in men or women who are not pregnant due to hormonal changes. In this case, it’s best to see a doctor for a diagnosis of the underlying causes.

### Can Linea Nigra Be Prevented?

There is no way to prevent linea nigra, although protecting your belly from sun exposure can keep the condition from worsening. It’s important to note that the use of skin lightening creams, especially those that contain hydroquinone, is not recommended during pregnancy.

### Linea Nigra Treatment Options:

Dermatologists and doctors recommend not treating linea nigra during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
Skin lightening creams often contain hydroquinone, which has not been proven safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women.
After pregnancy, linea nigra will resolve on its own, although it can take several months.

### The following methods may help linea nigra fade sooner.

- Lightening creams or bleaches; only if not breastfeeding
- Protecting the belly from excess sun exposure
- Ingesting folic acid from dark leafy greens and fortified whole wheat breads
- A homemade mask made with lemon, raw sugar, and honey applied on the abdomen and left for 10-15 minutes can lighten the linea nigra. You can do it a few times a week.

This common skin condition is nothing to worry about, and does go away over time once your hormones have returned to pre-pregnancy levels.
