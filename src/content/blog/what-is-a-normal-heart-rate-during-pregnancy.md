Heart rate normally increases during pregnancy, as the body works to pump blood to the organs and placenta.
During pregnancy, the amount of blood pumped by the heart (cardiac output) increases by 30 to 50%. As cardiac output increases, the heart rate at rest speeds up from a normal prepregnancy rate of about 70 beats per minute to as high as 90 beats per minute.

Many pregnant people also experience a drop in blood pressure, especially in early pregnancy.

### What is a normal heart rate during pregnancy?

There is no standard definition of a pregnancy heart rate that is too high or too low. Instead, doctors look at a person’s baseline heart rate and how their heart rate changes over time.
The study also found that the average heart rate rises steadily through pregnancy. At 10 weeks, the average heart rate was 79.3 BPM. By 40 weeks, the average rate was 86.9 BPM.
A 2019 meta-analysis looked at heart rate increases in 36,239 pregnant people. The authors found the average heart rate increase was around 10%, or 7–8 beats per minute (BPM)Trusted Source.

A person’s heart rate during pregnancy may be higher or lowerTrusted Source than these figures if their prepregnancy heart rate is higher or lower.
Brief heart palpitations and slight changes in pregnancy heart rate are common.
A 2007 studyTrusted Source emphasizes that while these changes in heart rate can signal a heart problem in rare cases, most are harmless.

### What causes an abnormal heart rate during pregnancy?

A person’s heart rate might not fall into the average range during pregnancy for a few reasons.

**1. Anxiety:**


Anxiety makes a person’s heart beat faster. Some people also become anxious when they notice their heart is beating quickly, which can lead to more anxiety.

**2. Heart disease:**

Sometimes, changes in heart rate signal a problem with the heart’s electrical system, a blocked artery, or other heart health problems.
Heart health issues are more common during pregnancy. Heart disease is a leading causeTrusted Source of pregnancy-related death.

**3. Abnormal starting heart rate:**

People with low or high resting heart rates may experience pregnancy heart rates that are also outside of the normal range.

**4. Preexisting arrhythmias:**

Arrhythmias are heart palpitations or other disturbances of the heart rate. People with a history of arrhythmias may find that pregnancy worsensTrusted Source their condition.

**5. Exercise:**

People who are physically active may have lower resting heart rates. This can extend to pregnancy.

### How to get heart rate into a normal range:

People whose heart rate falls outside their normal range should focus on why this happens, rather than trying to reach a particular number of BPM. Talk to a doctor before trying to change the heart rate.

In general, a healthful lifestyle may help a person remain healthy during pregnancy and can support a normal heart rate.

**Eat a healthful diet:**

Talk to a doctor about how best to nourish the body during pregnancy.
Most pregnant people need 2,200–2,900 calories per day. This varies with age, body size, activity level, and other factors.
Proteins, fruits, vegetables, and other nourishing foods can help protect the heart.

**Exercise:** 

Moderate exercise is usually safe during pregnancy, but talk to a doctor before trying a new or difficult routine.
Most pregnant people need at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week.
Try walking, swimming, and other low-impact options. Yoga or stretching may help support healthy muscles and reduce pregnancy aches and pains.

**Get proper prenatal care:**

See a doctor or midwife at least once during the first trimester, then schedule appointments regularly according to the healthcare provider’s recommendations.
Regular prenatal care involves monitoring heart health and can reduce the risk of developing an untreated heart issue.

**Manage anxiety and mental health:**
