However here are some most common pregnancy myths. So let’s take a look!
Common pregnancy myths:

### There are myths about everything surrounding -

### Start eating for two:
Perhaps the most common myth out there is that the moment you are pregnant, you should start eating for two. This is not only not true but can also be harmful for you as excessive weight gain can impact both you and your baby’s health. In fact, it is normal to keep the same intake of calories or some more during the first trimester. Even in the later stages, it is not advised to eat for two but gradually increase the calorie intake, a number that is decided by taking into account your health and your pre-pregnancy weight. Eating right and eating healthy during pregnancy is what is most important! And in today’s world, your doctor will likely recommend you to a dietician to better understand what and how much to eat during this time.

### Morning sickness only happens in the morning:
Unfortunately, the not-so-welcome nausea and vomiting that occur when you’re pregnant can happen morning, noon or night. But don’t worry — they usually fade early in the second trimester.
Why is it called morning sickness then? Well, the misleading nickname probably came about because having an empty stomach like when you wake up in the morning can make that nausea more pronounced.

### Exercise pregnancy myths:
You shouldn’t do any exercise during pregnancy - haven’t you heard that already? The most common misconception is that one shouldn’t do any physical exercise when pregnant. However, unless the doctor has specifically prescribed bed rest due to some bodily conditions, it is advisable to include some form of exercise or the other in your daily routine. From yoga and walking to swimming - there’s a plethora of exercises you can do to stay healthy. Just make sure to check-in with your doctor before you start anything new and your doctor will be able to guide you on physical activities depending on the needs, your previous habits and the stage of pregnancy.

### What you had before you knew you were pregnant can harm your baby:
For the first weeks after conception, many women may not be aware of their pregnancy and may have had a glass of wine or some exotic food or even an over-the-counter drug. However, doctors say that the ill effects’ causing substances are under a limited list and many of these things may have no impact at all. However, to be on the safe side, inform your doctor of all your worries as soon as you find out you are pregnant, so your doctor can help you alleviate those worries.

### No sex during pregnancy:
Having sex during pregnancy can hurt your baby - it’s time to debunk this myth. While some postures may be uncomfortable, sex during pregnancy is absolutely okay as per doctors. You can ask your doctor for any precautions or safe positions but do not shy away from intimate time with your partner.

### You can miscarry if you lift heavy objects, take the stairs or do exercises:
According to doctors, miscarriages can be caused by various hormonal and other factors and not by doing regular activities. As long as you stick to what’s comfortable to you and not engage in high-risk adventures like horse-racing and sky-diving etc., you should be fine. As your centre of gravity shifts during this time, you are prone to be imbalanced, so it’s better to be cautious during any activity.

### Big bellies have difficult deliveries:
Another unfounded myth - your belly size doesn’t determine what type of birth you will have or how easy or difficult it will be. The additional weight gain can depend on many factors like your body weight, water retention etc. and a big belly doesn’t always signify a big baby.

### Avoid all seafood during pregnancy:
Many women are asked to completely cut down on seafood during pregnancy. The risk of mercury and thus fish like king mackerel and swordfish should be avoided. It is also best to avoid raw fish during this time, unless your doctor gives you a go-ahead on the same. Consult your doctor for what to eat and what not to eat during this time, without paying heed to myths.

### Flying while pregnant can cause a miscarriage:
In general, airline travel is safe if you’re expecting, but there are things to keep in mind. For one, you’re at higher risk of developing blood clots when you’re seated for long periods of time. To prevent this from happening, make sure you stand up and walk the aisle every couple of hours.

### Heartburn indicates that baby will have full head of hair:
Doctors agree that heartburn only indicates that you ate something which caused indigestion and you should watch your diet to avoid it. Avoiding spicy, fried food and big meals, can significantly reduce heartburn during pregnancy and your baby can still have a normal amount of hair!

### Avoid all caffeine completely:
According to gynaecologists, one or two servings of caffeine is absolutely safe during pregnancy unless you have some other conditions like heartburn, which may be worsened by hot drinks.

### Note:
As explained above, it’s best to verify all the information that you come across when you are pregnant before implementing them. People love sharing stories and may be more than eager to give you a fair share of their experiences or what they might have heard. However, this can be misinformation or simply cause anxiety so it’s better to make a list of things to ignore when you are pregnant, with myths topping the list. Always get verified information from your doctor or physician before you start or stop anything new.
