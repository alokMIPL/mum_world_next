Most lactating mothers worry about the increased possibilities of weight gain after breastfeeding. This is because lactation assists in postpartum weight loss. During exclusive nursing (the first six months), you may consume an excess of about 400-500 kilocalories per 24 hours for milk production. However, the process of breastfeeding affects the metabolism, due to which you may end up losing some weight.
You’ve probably heard of how breastfeeding burns about 300 to 500 calories every day. This surely may have seemed to you a great way to start shedding that pregnancy weight. But on the flip side, you may also have heard that many moms gain weight after they stop breastfeeding the baby. Rapid weight gain after stopping breastfeeding is common? Is it something that you need to worry about? Let’s find out.
In this post, we discuss the effects of lactation and its link with maternal weight gain. While on the topic, note that dieting is not recommended during lactation as it may comprise the nutritional needs of the mother and the baby.

### Will You Gain Weight Once You Stop Nursing?

Weight gain in breastfeeding mothers is quite common, and this may be due to a combination of reasons, including increased calorie intake, lower calories burnt, and hormones. Hormonal changes that happen within your body right from the minute you get pregnant continue even after delivery and until you wean your baby. These hormones are responsible for quite a few body changes in pregnant women, even once you stop breastfeeding.
There is no substantial research-based evidence that links weaning and weight gain. It is true that breastfeeding burns more calories and also makes metabolism more efficient. The weight gain after cessation of breastfeeding could vary from one woman to another. While some women gain weight after they wean their babies. This does not happen with all women.
However, may not be the case with mothers who exercise while and after breastfeeding and are conscious about their diet and calorie intake.

### What Causes Weight Gain After Weaning Your Baby?
Some women may notice weight gain after they wean their baby.

**1.Hormonal changes:** Once you stop breastfeeding, hormones begin to drop. Both oxytocin and prolactin play an essential role in your emotional wellness. Some women may experience depression or feel low, causing them to binge eat, which could cause weight gain.

**2.Caloric surplus:** Your appetite may increase during breastfeeding, and it may stay that way for a while even after you wean your baby. The excess calories may eventually lead to weight gain. The effects of caloric surplus could be compounded by a lack of physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle.

### Tips To Avoid Weight Gain After Weaning:

The following tips could help you manage your food intake to shed the extra weight you gained after weaning your baby. And you can also make the following changes to your lifestyle.

- Keep an eye on what you eat and try to work on reducing the food intake.

- You may exercise 15-20 times multiple times a day.
