You’ve decided the time has come to stop breastfeeding. There isn’t an exact way to know how long it will take for your milk supply to dry up. You can start by slowly decreasing the number of times you nurse your baby.
When you stop breastfeeding, only one thing's for certain: You're bound to run into some surprises. Just like every other aspect of motherhood, weaning very rarely happens the way we think it's going to. But no matter your baby's age, there are some tips and tricks that can make the process easier.

### How to Stop Breastfeeding:

Everyone will be different when it comes to weaning, but in general, there are some steps you can follow to initiate the end of breastfeeding, such as looking for signs your baby is ready to wean from breastfeeding. There's no right or wrong way to stop breastfeeding. For lots of mothers and babies, stopping breastfeeding happens gradually as the child grows and eats more solid foods. 

<!-- ![stop breastfeed](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/7d906beb-bc9b-4377-9b06-b22a3566899c/images.jpeg-111.jpg/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280) -->

It's important that solid food should not simply replace breast milk. There's evidence that breast milk may play a part in helping a baby's digestive system to deal with their first solids.

Once they're eating solids, your baby will still need to have breast milk or formula as their main drink up to at least their 1st birthday.

Cows' milk is not suitable as a main drink for babies under 1 year old, although it can be added to foods, such as mashed potatoes.

Carrying on breastfeeding while giving your baby some formula can work very well.

Additionally, setting a schedule, starting out slowly, offering other ways of soothing to your baby, and enlisting help in feeding your baby can help. Here's how to stop breastfeeding your baby in easy steps.

### Recognize the signs your baby is ready to stop breastfeeding:

Your baby will give some clues that they're ready to wean.


- acting indifferent or cranky during nursing sessions
- sitting with support
- holding their head in an upright position
- expressing interest in what you're eating
- losing their active tongue-thrust reflex

### Set a schedule for weaning:
Allow yourself a full month to successfully stop chestfeeding; this gives you and your baby extra breathing room for obstacles and setbacks. Also, you should avoid weaning during a major life change like teething, moving homes, starting daycare, etc. and realize your baby will be more apt to cooperate when they aren't overly tired or hungry.

### Start out slowly:
Phasing out breastfeeding gently will give you both time to get used to the idea. Stopping gradually will also help prevent problems like overfull, hard breasts and mastitis.
Easing into a weaning routine allows you and your baby to adjust to the change. For instance, you may omit one breastfeeding session per week—probably the most inconvenient feeding or the one your baby's least interested in and gradually drop feedings until they're solely having bottles and solids. 


**Note:** _If your baby is 9 months or older, it's best to wean directly to a cup, so you don't have to deal with weaning them off the bottle in a few months._

By going slowly, you'll produce less and less milk, which will make weaning more comfortable for you. It will also make weaning more pleasant for your baby since they'll be progressively adjusting to nursing less and drinking more from the bottle or cup. You may even avoid triggering an episode of mastitis, which can be a painful infection caused by clogged ducts, which can occur during engorgement.

### Provide emotional comfort:
Breastfed babies love close physical contact with their parents, so when you're weaning, it's important to provide comfort in other ways. For example, you can spend quality one-on-one time with activities that keep them emotionally stimulated—cuddling together while reading a book or singing a lullaby, romping around together at the playground, or massaging their back.

### Consider letting your little one lead:
Some babies excel at weaning when they're in control. If you're OK with letting your baby call the shots, rely on the tried-and-true "don't offer, don't refuse" method. In a nutshell, you nurse when your child expresses interest, but you don't actually initiate it. It's not the quickest weaning strategy, but it ensures your baby's needs are met.

### Expect resistance when you stop breastfeeding:
It's normal for babies to resist weaning. Just know that, after a day or two of mourning the loss of the breast, most little ones will begin eating solid foods and drinking liquids from a bottle or sippy cup without problems. Healthy babies generally eat when they're hungry enough, no matter how badly they'd like to nurse.

### Learn how to prevent or soothe engorgement:
Another reason to take it slow: You can experience engorgement in your breasts after nursing ends quickly. Why? Your milk ducts miss the memo that they need to reduce milk production, and all that milk has nowhere to go. If you're engorged, soothe the pain with cool ice packs or acetaminophen. Or reach for your trusty breast pump; you can serve the pumped milk in a bottle or mix it with your baby's cereal

### Understand your own emotions:
Your baby isn't the only one who has to adjust to weaning. You must deal with a whirlwind of emotions—for example, some parents want their bodies back, while others feel rejected when their baby passes up the breast. Though you may be pleased to end nursing once and for all, it's totally natural to feel pangs of nostalgia about your baby getting older. Your best bet? Embrace their independence, know that weaning is an emotional experience, and talk to other breastfeeding mothers who can relate.

### Consider partially stopping breastfeeding:
All-or-nothing isn't your only option. Many working parents opt for partial weaning, where a caregiver bottle feeds during the day, and you nurse when you're home.

### Common reasons for stopping breastfeeding:

**Not enough breast milk:** Lots of women worry that their baby is not getting enough milk when in fact they have plenty to meet their baby's needs.

**Getting pregnant again:** If you get pregnant again while you're breastfeeding, it should not affect your baby or the pregnancy. However, you may feel tired, and changes in your appetite and emotions can make breastfeeding more challenging.

**Going back to work:** Some women worry about breastfeeding and returning to work. Going back to work does not necessarily mean you have to stop breastfeeding.
If your breast milk supply is well established, going back to work does not have to affect your milk supply for your baby. You can either express at work and give your breast milk to your child's carer, or provide formula milk while you're away.

**Taking some medicines:** Most medicines can be taken while you're breastfeeding without harming your baby.
But it's always best to tell a doctor, dentist or pharmacist if you're breastfeeding.

**Sore or painful breasts:** Some women find breastfeeding uncomfortable, especially in the early days and weeks. Common problems include sore or cracked nipples and painful breasts.
These problems can often happen when your baby is not positioned or attached well at the breast.

**Breastfeeding older children:** There's no reason why you should not continue breastfeeding your child into their 2nd year and beyond. You and your toddler can continue to enjoy the benefits of breastfeeding for as long as you want to.
Your toddler may also find breastfeeding comforting when they're ill or upset.
