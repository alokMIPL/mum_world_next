### You will need: 

- Broken Wheat - 2 tbsp
- Dates - 2
- Soaked Almonds - 4
- Powdered jaggery - 1.5 tbsp optional
- Water - ¼ cup + ¾ cup
- Cows milk - ½ cup don't add for
 babies under one year

### How to Prepare:

- Take 2 tablespoon of broken wheat in a pressure cooker along with de-seeded dates, peeled almonds.
- Add ¾ cup of water and close the lid of the pressure cooker. Pressure cook it for three whistles and open the cooker once the pressure released.
- Add ¼ cup of water to the powdered jaggery and boil in a separate vessel until it melts completely. Then filter out the jaggery water using a strainer. Set aside.
- Now take the pressure cooked broken wheat, dates and almonds in a blender along with filtered jaggery water. Blend them until smooth.
- Transfer the blended broken wheat into a saucepan and switch on the flame. Add ½ cup of milk (Skip adding milk if you are preparing this porridge for a baby under one year ) to the saucepan and mix everything slowly with a whisk.
- Boil the porridge in low, medium flame. Stir it continuously while cooking otherwise porridge may stick to the vessel. Boil the porridge until it becomes thick.
- Remove from the flame once done and cool it down. The porridge becomes thick after cooling down. So switch off the flame accordingly.
