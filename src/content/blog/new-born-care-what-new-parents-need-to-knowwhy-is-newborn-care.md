The initial months with your newborn can be confusing and yet extremely overwhelming for first-time parents. Deciding what to and what not to follow in regards to newborn care can be complex. 
Expect various kinds of advice from everyone about newborn baby care. Caring for a newborn is pretty exhausting and may come across as super challenging, but it is also one of the most amazing experiences of your life. Read on for all you need to know about caring for your newborn baby.

### At What Age Is A Newborn No Longer A Newborn? 

As per WHO, a newborn infant is a child under 28 days of age. A baby is only considered a newborn for his first 2-3 months of life. Next is the infant stage, lasting till your baby turns 1 year old.

### Why Is Newborn Care Important?

Each and every newborn life requires essential care as they have just entered a new environment, wherein, they were first inside a safe and secure shell, a mother’s womb. This is why, to minimize the risk of infections and maximize their growth and development is extremely important to give them the right amount of everything and love, warmth and care the most.

### How Do You Take Care Of A Newborn Baby?

Taking care of a newborn can surely be a tough task for a first-time mommy. Here are the few newborn care basics that are going to help you:

**1. Feeding**

You would have to feed them every 2-3 hours which means you have to nurse them 8-12 times in 24 hours. 
Remember, it is extremely important to feed your newborn on time. Moreover, you should make sure to only breastfeed or give formula milk to your baby for the first 6 months.  Breast milk is best for new born, it contains all the vital nutrients and antibodies required for your newborn’s growth and development.
In case your breast milk is not enough for baby, then you can give top feed (formula milk to babies).

**2. How To Hold Your Newborn**

Pay attention to holding your newborn baby’s neck whenever you pick them up.
Ensure that while holding your newborn, you are supporting the back of their neck as the neck muscles are still developing and are not strong enough to hold the weight of the head altogether. The backbone is still developing and becoming stronger day by day. For the neck to be able to support the head on its own, it would take around 3-4 months of age. 

**3. Burping**

Try to gently hold your baby against your chest with one hand. Their chin should be resting on your shoulder and now start patting gently on their back with your other hand until they burp.
While the babies are having their feed, they tend to swallow air which causes gas in their tummies. Burping helps to get rid of this gas by expelling excess air, aiding in digestion and preventing spit-ups. 


**4.Massage Them**

Massage helps in soothing them and eventually to sleep and in improving blood circulation and even digestion.
Bond with your baby by massaging them. Spread a small quantity of baby oil or moisturizer on your hands. After this, gently on their body. Maintain eye contact, smile, laugh, and talk to them when massaging their body. A good time to massage your baby is before they take a bath.

**5. Diapering** 

Changing diapers frequently is a crucial part when taking care of a newborn baby after delivery. To change a dirty diaper, you will need a changing sheet, gentle diaper wipes, diaper rash cream or baby powder, and fresh diapers. If your baby is being provided with sufficient breast milk/ formula milk, they will wet at least 6 to 8 diapers in a day, along with regular poo-poos. Change their diaper, as soon as you feel it’s full and wipe them from front to back to prevent the risk of urinary tract infection.You might have to change it at least 10 times a day too.

**6. Sleeping**

On average, newborns need to sleep for about 16 hours a day in the first 2 months.
Every baby is different and it is obvious that they would have different sleeping cycles.  They mostly take naps for around 2 to 4 hours and wake up if they are wet or hungry. Try to utilize this time and take a nap of your own with them or have a peaceful cup of tea or coffee.

**7.Trimming The Nails**

Remember to trim their nails by using a baby clipper. DO NOT trim the nails very deeply as it can be painful for them. Refrain from cutting the edges of the nails as this can cause painful ingrown nails.
Your newborn baby’s nails will surely grow very fast and because of this, they may scratch their body or face with their hand movements. 

**8. Play Time**

Make sure you have play time with your new born and keep these few things in mind when playing with your baby:
- Always wash your hands before picking up your baby.
- Do not throw your baby up into the air.
- Do not shake your baby as their internal organs are delicate enough that they can get damaged by vigorous shaking.
