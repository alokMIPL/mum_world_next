### What Is False Labor?

False labor have been referred to as **"Braxton Hicks"**. They can occur as early as the fourth month but become frequent as your due date approaches. These contractions signify false labor as there is a pain but no dilation of the cervix. They are perfectly normal and have been said to represent contractions that occur as the uterus is preparing to give birth.
Braxton Hicks contractions are typically less painful than those of true labor and are unpredictable, do not occur at regular intervals. Braxton Hicks contractions do not become more intense over time. Dehydration and physical activity may trigger Braxton Hicks contractions.
As your due date approaches, you begin to guard for every possible sign of labor, thinking if it is real labor or not. However, differentiating between real and false labor is quite difficult because some signs and contractions are identical in both scenarios. Therefore, it’s difficult to distinguish false labor so you don’t stress out every time.
This post explains the indicators of labor signs and tells you the differences between false and real ones.

Like true labor, false labor are not typically as painful. Some women describe them as a tightening sensation across the lower abdomen. In some women, this may feel similar to menstrual cramps. The abdomen may become firm to the touch and feel like a muscle tightening in your abdomen or a squeezing sensation in the lower abdomen. These contractions do not continue for long; they neither get stronger nor closer with time. False Labor usually last about 15 to 30 seconds, but may continue as long as two minutes, at times.
If these contractions are felt towards the last weeks of pregnancy, they indicate that your true labor is not very far.

It comes at regular intervals and then gets closer and stronger over time. Each contraction lasts for 20-60 seconds.
