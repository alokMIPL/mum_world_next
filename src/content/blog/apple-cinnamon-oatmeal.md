### You will Need:

- Rolled oats: (At the store, These are also called old-fashioned oats)
- Apple: Any kind of apple works here.
- Raisins: You can use regular or golden raisins in this oatmeal. Or another dried fruit like cranberries or cherries.
- Pure vanilla extract
- Cinnamon: (Adds lovely flavor so use it if you have it, optional)
- Milk

### How to Prepare:

- Assemble the ingredients and grate the apple.
- Heat water in a medium pot over high heat. When itâ€™s almost about to boil, lower to medium low and add all ingredients except the optional nut or seed butter and optional toppings.
- Cook, stirring often, until the oats are softened and the water is absorbed, about 10-12minutes.
- Remove from heat and let sit. Stir in the milk and add optional toppings and serve warm.
