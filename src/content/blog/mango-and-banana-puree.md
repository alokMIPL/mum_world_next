### You will need: 

- 1 banana
- 1 small mango

### How to Prepare:

- Peel the banana and mango. Stand the mango on end and slice down.
- Trim any remaining flesh from the pit and discard the pit.
- Cut the mango and banana into chunks.
- Transfer the fruit to a blender or food processor. Process the fruit to a very smooth or chunky puree, depending on your baby's age and chewing ability.
- If needed, add a little water, breast milk, or formula to thin the puree.
- Refrigerate the puree in an airtight container for up to three days, or freeze for up to three months.

**(Storage tip: Spoon into ice-cube trays for single servings that are easy to thaw. Some discoloration may occur.)**
