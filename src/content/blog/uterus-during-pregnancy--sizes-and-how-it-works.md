The uterus plays a crucial role in pregnancy as the abode of the infant, and it constantly expands during your gestation journey to hold the developing fetus.
The uterus creates the placenta for fetal development and blood vessels to nurture it.
When you think of pregnancy, the first thing you may envision is a growing belly. While this is a visible change of pregnancy that is hard to ignore, myriad transformations occur inside a pregnant woman’s body. The most important change is the size of the uterus during pregnancy.
This post discusses interesting details about the uterus, including its size during and before pregnancy, functions, and positions. It also mentions how to maintain a healthy uterus.

### Uterus During Pregnancy:

The uterus is a distensible organ the size of a closed fist. It grows and changes to become large enough to accommodate a full-term baby. It is held in its position by ligaments, which stretch as the uterus grows.
Size Of Uterus During Pregnancy
As you know, the uterus keeps changing in shape and size as your pregnancy progresses. The uterus expands between 500 and 1,000 times its normal size (1). Let’s see how the organ changes during each trimester.

### The first trimester (0 to 12 weeks)

- At 12 weeks of pregnancy, the size of the uterus remains as small as the size of a grapefruit.

- As your pregnancy progresses, the uterus grows, putting pressure on the bladder. This is when the frequency of urination increases (2).

- In the case of twins or multiple pregnancies, the stretching of the uterus will be faster compared to that of a single baby.

### The second trimester (14-28 weeks)

- By the second trimester, the uterus grows to the size of a papaya. The uterus grows upward and develops outside the pelvic area.

- The uterus expands between the naval area and the breasts and starts putting thrust on the other organs, pushing them away from their original positions (3). This may lead to some tensions in the ligaments and the surrounding muscles, leading to body aches and pains.

- In some cases, the naval may pop out because of the pressure put by the uterus on other organs.


### The third trimester (28-40 weeks)

- By the third trimester, your uterus will get enlarged to the size of a watermelon. It will move from your pubic brim to the lower bottom of the rib cage.
- Once you approach labor, your baby will descend into the pelvis.
After childbirth

After childbirth, the uterus shrinks back to its normal position and size. This process is known as involution, which will take about six to eight weeks (4).

Apart from changing in size to accommodate the growing fetus, the uterus also plays other roles during pregnancy.

### Functions Of The Uterus During Pregnancy :
**During pregnancy, the uterus:**

- Accepts the fertilized ovum that passes through the fallopian tube.

- Creates the placenta for the development of the fetus.

- Nurtures the fetus with nutrients by developing blood vessels exclusively for this purpose.

- Contracts to facilitate the exit of the baby and the placenta through the vagina during childbirth.

- Post-delivery, it shrinks back and starts preparing for the next menstrual cycle.

- It helps the blood flow into the ovaries. It supports other organs such as the vagina, bladder, and rectum. It plays an important role in sexual functions like triggering orgasm (5).

### Measuring The Uterus During Pregnancy

Your doctor might measure the size of your uterus, also called the fundal height (fundus is the domed region at the top of the uterus), to understand the fetal growth and development. The fundal height is the measurement of the top of the pubic bone to the top of the uterus, which determines the gestational age.

**Note:** It should be noted that the size of the uterus varies from woman to woman and depends on height, weight, and age.
