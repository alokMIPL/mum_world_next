### What does normal delivery mean?
Delivery of a full-term newborn baby, between 37-42 weeks through the vagina without the use of forceps or vacuum for assistance is called a normal delivery of a baby. It is the most preferred option of delivery.


### What does cesarean delivery mean?
Cesarean delivery is a surgical procedure to deliver babies through a
vertical or horizontal  incision on the mother’s belly. The operation is used to save the mother and baby’s life. It is also called C-section or cesarean section.
During this surgery, the mother’s belly muscles are separated to make a incision on the wall of the womb. Then, the baby is extracted through the womb wall, and the womb and belly are closed with stitches.


### What Is Better: Normal or Cesarean Delivery?
Vaginal delivery has far fewer risks to both the mother and baby than cesarean delivery. Each has its own set of positives and negatives. Vaginal birth is a natural way of giving birth, but it is prudent to discuss with your doctor, which is a safer option for you in your current condition. 

### Advantages of Normal (vaginal) delivery:

- There is less risk of blood loss, scarring, infections, and complications related to anesthesia or pain medications.
- Vaginal delivery removes fluids from the baby’s lungs as it passes through the birth passage.
- Access to beneficial bacteria to the baby while passing through the birth canal may support the baby’s immunity system.
- It allows more immediate contact between the mother and baby.
- It allows for quicker initiation of breastfeeding.
- Short hospital stays are usually two- to three days long.
- Quick recovery is often just within a few days to a week.

### Risks of vaginal delivery:

- The process is longer and more physically demanding for the mother.
- It may stretch the vagina, or the risk of vaginal tear and internal injuries is higher and may alleviate sometimes by an episiotomy or stitches.
- Possible risk of complications in the mother such as loss of bowel control and urine control may be lifelong.
- There is a higher risk of moderate-to-severe stress incontinence (urine control) in women who delivered vaginally than those who delivered by cesarean (10% vs 5%).
- There will be a sore groin area usually just for a few days.
- There is a possible weakening of the groin muscles.
- There is a higher risk of adverse outcomes in a twin delivery.

### Advantages of cesarean delivery:

- Cesarean is often safer than vaginal delivery in case of the danger posed to the mother or baby due to a medical condition and reduces the death rate and illnesses in the mother and baby.
- Deliveries can be scheduled according to the convenience of the mother or for the relatives.
- Elective cesarean delivery has become an easy way out, is efficient, and predictable.-For mother;
- Provides a modest protective effect against loss of urine control later in life.-For babies;
- Cesarean delivery is a life-saving operation for them in dangerous situations during the birth process.
- It reduces mortality and morbidity rates in babies during birth.

### Disadvantages of cesarean delivery:

- Prolonged hospital stays.
- Less likely chances of the early beginning of breastfeeding.
- Higher risks of repeating hospitalizations for both the mother and baby.
- Expensive means of delivery

### Risks for mother are that there is

- A higher risk of blood loss or blood clots.
- Prolonged recovery period.
- Pain at the surgical incision site.
- Five times higher illness and death rate during cesarean delivery than during vaginal delivery due to complications such as
- Bleeding.
- Sepsis (a life-threatening infection in the body).
- A higher risk of mother’s death during cesarean delivery than that during vaginal delivery due to uterine scarring.
- A higher risk of placental issues and womb rupture in future pregnancies, which may increase severe illness, complications, and death rate in mothers.
- A higher risk of the requirement of cesarean delivery in future pregnancies.
- A weakening of the belly muscles.

### Risks for baby:

- There is a higher risk of breathing issues such as asthma in babies that may extend up to their childhood.
- Chances of development of a strong immune system are low in babies born with cesarean delivery, and the risk of asthma, atopic dermatitis (skin allergy), and celiac disease (gluten intolerance) is higher in these children.
- There is a higher possibility of the baby being admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after delivery.
- Premature delivery or early-term delivery may carry a significant risk of pulmonary complications in babies, especially in babies born through cesarean delivery without labor.
- There is a higher chance of the baby being born dead (stillbirth).


If you have questions about each type of delivery, make sure to talk to your doctor during your routine prenatal visits. They can help you understand which option is best for you.
