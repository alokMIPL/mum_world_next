During pregnancy, your body’s calcium reserves can plummet.
That is why it is important to consume foods that are rich in calcium.

### Some of the best sources of calcium are:
- Milk
- Dairy products
- Seafood like salmon and sardines
- Dried fruits
- Soya
- Dark green leafy vegetables

### 2. Iron-rich foods:

As mentioned before, a miscarriage can cause heavy bleeding. That can cause depletion in the amount of iron in your body. You may even experience anemia and other symptoms of iron deficiency due to your miscarriage. Feelings of weakness and fatigue are common after a miscarriage. That is why it is important to consume iron-rich foods after a pregnancy loss.


The best kind of iron to consume after a miscarriage is heme-iron. It is the kind of iron that is easily absorbed by the body. Lean meat is a good source of heme-iron. So consume red meat in plenty after a miscarriage. But remember to cook it well. Avoid frying it. You can grill it instead.

### Other sources of non-heme iron includes:
- Beans
- Green leafy vegetables
- Brussels Sprouts
- Raisins
- Lentils
- Dried Peaches
- Pumpkin Seeds
- Soybeans
- Sesame butter (Tahini)
- Brown Rice
- Dark Chocolate
- Molasses

Apart from consuming these iron-rich foods, try consuming foods that are rich in vitamin C. These foods can help in better absorption of iron by the body. Fruit, including lemon, oranges, papaya, strawberries and grapefruits should be a part of your post-miscarriage diet.

### 3. Fruits and vegetables:
You need to consume ample amount of fruits and vegetables to get the nutrients your body needs after a miscarriage.

### 4.Feel-good foods:
Mourning the loss of a baby can plunge you into depression. The feeling of depression varies among women. Some women can bounce back pretty easily after a miscarriage while others can mourn for months and even years. No matter the category you fall in, you are a survivor. How you deal with your loss is nobody else’s business. But you can consume some comfort food to help deal with post-miscarriage depression.
You can consume foods rich in magnesium to recover from depression.

### Some of the foods you can try include:
- Nuts
- Beans
- Plain chocolate

Magnesium not just helps you deal with depression but also helps your body’s energy production, cell repair as well as nerve and muscle functions.

### Foods To Avoid After Miscarriage:
A healthy diet doesn’t just mean consuming nourishing food. It also means saying no to food that is not good for your body! Some of the foods you should avoid after miscarriage includes: 


### 1. Low-fiber starches:
Carbohydrates provide your body with the fuel it needs and also controls your body’s sugar levels. But refined grains or low-fiber starches can have an adverse impact on your body. They can cause rapid fluctuations in your body’s sugar levels. That is why it is important to limit the amount of low fiber starch in your diet. 


### 2. Sweets:
Avoid sugary foods with a high glycemic index as they too can cause fluctuating blood sugar levels. 


### 3. Fatty milk and meats:
The fats in meat and dairy products can cause inflammation. So avoid fatty meats and dairy products after a miscarriage. After a miscarriage, it is important to avoid inflammation that can cause you pain and discomfort.

### 4. Junk food:
You may crave junk food, and it is okay to eat some in moderation. But do not make junk food your main course after a miscarriage. Junk food will just fill you with empty calories and prevent you from consuming nutrient rich food that your body needs right now.

### 5. Soy products:
Soy is good for your health; there is no doubt about that. But it is also full of phytate, which prevents your body from absorbing iron. So, limit the amount of soy product, you consume after a miscarriage.
