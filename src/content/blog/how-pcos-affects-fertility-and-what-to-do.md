### What is PCOS?

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition involving hormonal imbalances and metabolism problems.
PCOS is a hormonal condition which affects about one in 10 women in their childbearing years. Women with PCOS have higher levels of insulin and androgens (male-type hormones) than other women.
This condition affects the ovaries, but doesn’t necessarily lead to infertility. You can get pregnant. However, PCOS is a common cause of infertility.
Research estimates that PCOS affect 5–13 percentTrusted Source of women of reproductive age. It’s treatable. Here’s how the condition can influence fertility and what you can do about it.

### How PCOS affect fertility?

On average, women with PCOS take longer to fall pregnant than other women. This can be because they have irregular periods which means that they don’t ovulate every month. Also, being overweight reduces fertility and can contribute to women with PCOS taking longer to conceive.

Although women with PCOS have more fertility problems than other women, they need reliable contraception to avoid unplanned pregnancy.

People with PCOS have a hormonal imbalance that can lead to:

- high levels of insulin in your blood
- high levels of hormones called androgens
- thickening of the outer shell of the ovaries
- the formation of small, painless, fluid-filled sacs in the ovaries

The prevalence of infertility in people with PCOS is thought to be between 70 and 80 percentTrusted Source.

### Symptoms of PCOS:

**They include,**

- Oily skin or severe acne
- Excess hair growth on the face or other places where males are typically more likely to have hair
- Skin tags on the neck or armpits
- Thinning hair on the scalp
- Weight gain or difficulty losing weight
- Patches of thick, darkened skin (acanthosis nigricans), particularly on the neck, groin, or underneath the breasts.


Symptoms that may suggest you have fertility problems include irregular or absent menstrual periods. You may not be ovulating regularly or at all.

You might also have insulin resistance, which leads to high levels of insulin in your blood. Untreated, this can lead to type 2 diabetes.

### Fertility treatments for women with PCOS:

There is currently no cure for PCOS, so treatment and management depends on the goal.
For infertility caused by PCOS, treatment involves correcting any ovulation issues and tackling metabolic problems, such as insulin resistance.

Hormonal birth control pills can be helpful for those who don’t wish to get pregnant. And there are treatments to help you ovulate and conceive. It can also be used to help regulate menstrual cycles and provide protection from endometriosis in women with irregular periods associated with PCOS.

Your doctor will probably recommend some basic health measures first.
If you don’t already, it’s a good time to start tracking your periods. There are many calendars and fertility apps designed to help you figure out which days you’re most likely ovulating.

### How can women with PCOS improve their chance of pregnancy?

Adopting a healthy lifestyle can improve the chance of a pregnancy and healthy baby. This includes being in the healthy weight range,
- Not smoking
- Cutting back on alcohol
- Eating a healthy diet
- Getting plenty of regular exercise
- Getting enough sleep

### PCOS and endometriosis:

If you are struggling with PCOS and infertility, and you are not responding to treatment, your doctor may look for another cause.

Endometriosis is a condition in which the type of tissue that lines the uterus grows elsewhere in the pelvis. This abnormal tissue growth can block the fallopian tubes or damage the egg or sperm.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, about 40 percent of women with infertility have endometriosis.

### Symptoms of endometriosis can include:

- Pelvic pain around menstruation or during sexual intercourse
- Jeavy periods
- Pain during bowel movements or urination

Not everyone with endometriosis has these symptoms.

A studyTrusted Source in 2019 addressed the overlap of PCOS and endometriosis.
The research included women with PCOS who hadn’t responded to clomiphene citrate. After a procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling, 7.7 percent were found to have incidental endometriosis.

### In vitro fertilization (IVF) :

Sometimes, lifestyle adjustments, medicines, and surgery don’t work. If that happens to you, IVF may be an option.

You’ll start by having fertility injections to stimulate your ovaries. You’ll probably produce multiple eggs at one time. Once the eggs are harvested, they’ll be fertilized with sperm.
Some fertilized eggs can be frozen for later use. Some will be transferred to your uterus to implant and develop. IVF may increase the likelihood of a multiple birth.

### When to talk with a doctor:

If you have symptoms of PCOS, see your doctor for diagnosis and treatment.

If you plan to get pregnant at any point, the sooner you start treatment for PCOS the better. Your doctor will guide you in how to proceed or refer you to a fertility specialist.

### Note:

PCOS is a condition that involves a hormonal imbalance that can interfere with ovulation.
Some people with PCOS have difficulty getting pregnant. There are effective treatments, though.
With medical intervention, many people with fertility problems due to PCOS are able to conceive. It’s also important to note that PCOS doesn’t mean you can never get pregnant. Always use contraception if you don’t want to conceive, even if you have PCOS.
