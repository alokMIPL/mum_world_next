Fruits are an important element of a balanced diet and provide numerous benefits as they are a powerhouse of essential nutrients. Your diet and nutrition is of utmost importance, and you’ll find yourself on the receiving end of a truckload of advice from friends, family, and relatives, most of which is fairly unsolicited. And one of the most frequently-doled out tip or rather warning is to avoid papayas during pregnancy, in any shape or form.

Eating fruits during pregnancy is suggested by doctors. But not all fruits are good for the pregnant women's. There is a lot of confusion around eating papaya in pregnancy.

Unripe papaya has a component known as latex. The presence of latex in unripe papaya can trigger uterine contractions, which can often cause miscarriage or early labor. 

Truth is papayas can be safely eaten during pregnancy. The misconception arises from a lack of understanding and unawareness. Ripe papayas come with a host of nutrients that are extremely beneficial for pregnant women. The culprit is raw or unripe papayas, which are known to cause complications for expectant mothers.

- Papain is known to disrupt cell growth and obstruct the development of tissues in the growing foetus. It can also potentially harm the embryo.
- Unripe papayas can cause uterine contractions and premature labour as the latex in papayas contain papain, a substance that stimulates certain hormones that induce contractions. Consuming papayas in early stages of pregnancy can also cause miscarriages as it stimulates and increases menstrual flow.
- Women who’ve had a history of miscarriages or premature labour need to be extremely cautious as they are more prone to having pregnancy complications due to the papain in unripe papayas.
- Unripe papayas are very harmful to the placenta. Papain is known to cause internal bleeding, and bleeding on the edges of placenta can further complicate the pregnancy and cause delivery-related problems, and hence one should refrain from eating papayas in the third trimester of pregnancy.
- Papayas increase bowel movement due to its high fibre content and this could create pressure around the uterus and pelvic region, leading to a possible miscarriage.
