Water is essential to perform different physiological functions in the body, and its need increases during pregnancy. So, how much water should a pregnant woman drink? Knowing this can help you stay adequately hydrated and reduce the risk of common pregnancy discomforts such as constipation, swelling, and urinary tract infections. The body derives water from the fluids and foods you consume, and its daily requirement depends on factors such as physical activity levels, body size, and weather conditions.

The foods you eat during pregnancy help build your baby – but so, too, does what you drink. Your water needs increase to support your pregnancy and your baby, which makes it important to stay hydrated. Here’s how to ensure you drink enough water throughout pregnancy.

Keep reading to know how much water you should drink when pregnant, its benefits, and practical tips to ensure sufficient water intake.
 

### Health benefits of drinking water:

Sipping on water may be one of the simplest steps you can take towards a healthy pregnancy. That’s because staying hydrated offers many health benefits. Drinking water:

**• Supports your body:** Somewhere around three-quarters of your body is made up of water – which helps to support digestion, regulate your body temperature, and create hormones, among many other essential functions.


**• Lowers the risk of UTIs:** Drinking water dilutes your urine and causes you to flush out bacteria as you pee more often, which reduces your risk of urinary tract and bladder infections.


**• Supports your pregnancy:** Your body needs more water during pregnancy for a number of reasons, including your increased metabolism (which requires water to hum along) and a significantly higher blood volume (which supplies your baby with the oxygen and nutrients he needs to grow).


**• Keeps you regular:** Fluids also help prevent common pregnancy problems such as constipation and hemorrhoids by keeping your bowels moving and your stools soft.


**• Reduces swelling:** If your feet and ankles are swollen, drinking more water can actually help. In fact, fluid retention can result from not drinking enough, because your body hangs on to more fluid if it senses it's becoming dehydrated. (If swelling is excessive or comes on suddenly, especially in your hands, legs, or face, contact your caregiver, as this can be a sign of preeclampsia.)
 

### Why Is It So Important To Hydrate During Pregnancy?

Besides the ones mentioned in the above section, water has additional functions during pregnancy. Water requirements increase during pregnancy to maintain maternal hydration and support fetal development. The physiological changesi that increase water demand during pregnancy include:

- Formation of the amniotic fluid
- Gradual increase of blood volume from six to eight weeks that peaks at 32 to 34 weeks
- Increased respiration that increases water output
- Changes in the urinary system, such as a slight increase in the kidney size, increased renal plasma flowi, glomerular filtration ratei, and urine volume (mostly at night and when lying down)
- More sweating due to increased activities of the adrenal and thyroid glands, accelerated metabolism, and increased blood supply to the skin.

### How much water to drink while pregnant:

Pregnant women should drink 8-12 cups, approximately  or 1.9 to 2.8 liters of water daily.

Your needs may vary based on your activity levels, your size, and the weather. For example, you're likely to need more fluid than usual when it’s hot outside or if you're exercising.

The best way to tell if you’re getting enough water: Your urine should look pale yellow or colorless, and you should feel thirsty only occasionally.
 

### How Much Water Is Needed In Each Trimester? 



Here’s how the water needs based on the increased calorie requirements can be calculated for each trimester.

**• First trimester:** Most normal-weight, healthy pregnant women need about 1800 calories daily in the first trimester. Thus, their total daily water requirement should be around 1.8 to 2.7 liters (approximately 61 to 91 ounces or 8 to 11 cups).

**• Second trimester:** Expecting women in the second trimester need  2200 calories daily. Hence, they should consume 2.2 to 3.3 liters (74 to 112 ounces or 9 to 14 cups) of water daily.

**• Third trimester:** During the third trimester, the recommended daily calorie intake is about 2400 calories, corresponding to a daily water requirement of 2.4 to 3.6 liters, or approximately 81 to 122 ounces, or 10 to 15 cups.

**Sufficient water intake during your pregnancy could help:**

- Reduce edemai
- Stay cool
- Enhance energy
- Alleviate morning sickness and nausea
- Aid digestion
- Reduce the risk of urinary tract infections
- Lower the risk of early contractions and preterm labor
- Hydrate skin
- Prevent constipation and associated hemorrhoidsi

### What Are The Signs Of Dehydration In Pregnancy?

Insufficient water intake during pregnancy can lead to dehydration. Dehydration is when one’s water intake is less than the water excreted, making it difficult for the body to perform different functions. The signs of dehydration in pregnant women may include:

- Fatigue
- Feeling thirsty
- Dark yellow or strong-smelling urine
- Dizziness
- Dryness of mouth, lips, and eyes
- Reduced urinary frequency, fewer than four times a day

Seek prompt medical guidance if these symptoms persist even after drinking enough water.

Drinking a calculated amount of water daily can be tiring, but these practical tips may help make it easier for you:

- Make it a habit to drink water first after you wake up. Also, drink some water after each meal and snack
- Keep a water bottle handy on the desk, or carry it around with you so you may remember to drink water
- Drink water whenever thirsty and before and after physical activity (9). Choose water over soda or energy drinks
- Prepare refreshing flavored water by adding mint leaves and slices of lemon or fruits, like strawberry, to the water
- Set a timer on your phone that will remind you to drink water from time to time.
- Freeze fresh fruits into ice cubes and add them to your glass of water for variety. You may use sparkling water.
