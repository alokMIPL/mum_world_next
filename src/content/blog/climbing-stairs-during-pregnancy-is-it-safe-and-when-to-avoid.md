You may often be advised against climbing stairs during pregnancy, even for a short distance.
You may be used to climbing the stairs if you need to reach the first or second floor of a building. 
But is this precaution scientifically relevant or can climbing the stairs be considered a safe form of exercise during pregnancy?

Keep reading this post where we tell you whether it is safe to take the stairs during pregnancy, whether it can be good for you, and what precautions to take while climbing them.

### Is Climbing Stairs Safe During Pregnancy:


It is safe to climb stairs during early pregnancy. One of the biggest fears in this regard is falling or tripping from the stairs. In the later months of pregnancy, a shift in the center of gravity of your body increases the risk of falls. At this stage, a fall from the stairs, especially on the abdomen, can lead to many complications.

In the 37th week, your baby drops into your pelvis, making it easier for you to breathe. However, the added weight of the full-term baby makes it difficult for you to climb the stairs. If you have to climb, take one step at a time, move slowly by holding the railing for support, and breathe at a normal rate.

### How Is Climbing Stairs Good During Pregnancy?  


Research shows climbing stairs is as good as walking or exercising.
It is a good physical activity, which keeps your body active.

- Low risk of preeclampsia: 
Pregnant women who climb stairs have a reduced risk for preeclampsia a condition wherein women have high blood pressure.
According to a study published in the American Heart Association’s journal called Hypertension.

The study has found that pregnant women, who are inactive, can reduce the risk of preeclampsia by 29% by climbing one to four flights of stairs.

- Reduces the chances of gestational diabetes: According to a study by the American Diabetes Association, climbing stairs in early pregnancy reduces the chances of getting gestational diabetes mellitus – one of the common complications in pregnancy.


### During Pregnancy, Basic Safety Tips For Climbing Stairs:

- While climbing up or coming down the stairs, make use of the handrail. If you are holding anything in one hand, then keep the other free to hold the handrail.
- Ensure that the staircase is well-lit to see the steps clearly. Avoid climbing the staircase in darkness.
- If you have a carpeted staircase, make sure it is tightly fixed to the floor and is not loose.
- Walk slowly and avoid any rush while climbing.
- Take a break while climbing the stairs if you are panting.
- The stairs should not be wet or greased.
- When you are wearing an overflowing dress, do not take the stairs as you have a high chance of tripping over it.
- Contact your doctor if you slipped on the stairs.
