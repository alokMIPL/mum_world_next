Performing a pregnancy test at home has become possible due to the availability of ready-to-use kits. You can procure these pregnancy test kits without a prescription at pharmacies. Though you may rely on this test, you need to get several other urine tests done at the clinic throughout your pregnancy. These tests may sound annoying, but their utility ranges from confirming pregnancy to detecting developmental anomalies in the growing fetus. This post presents important information about conducting a home pregnancy test, the various urine tests required during pregnancy, and their significance for you and your baby.

### What Is Urine Home Pregnancy Test?

During pregnancy, your placenta produces the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, which appears in the urine and blood about ten days after your missed period. This is the time when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus. The home pregnancy test detects the presence of hCG in urine.
In the initial eight to ten weeks, hCG levels increase rapidly. They reach the peak during the tenth week and then decline until the end of your pregnancy.

### What Does Urine Test Show?

The urine test confirms pregnancy if you take it around one to two weeks after missed periods. It helps you know whether or not hCG is present in the urine. It is a qualitative test and does not give you the quantity of the hormone present in your body. The presence of hCG is a positive sign of pregnancy.

### Steps To Follow For An Accurate Urine Test To Confirm Pregnancy:

**1. Know when to take the test:**

Wait for about one to two weeks after you miss your period to get the best results. You may tend to miscalculate when your period is due in the case of irregular periods, and this can affect the test. In fact, out of every 100 pregnant women, 10 to 20 will not be able to detect their pregnancy on the first day of their missed period due to miscalculated periods.

**2. Check the expiration date:**

If you are planning to take a home pregnancy urine test, check for the expiry date, because the newer the pregnancy kit, the better the results. Also check for the condition of the kit packaging (the open seal, wear and tear, etc.).
If you have stocked up a pregnancy kit from months ago, do not use it.

**3. Test in the morning:**

Going for a morning urine pregnancy test (first urine in the morning) helps you get the most accurate results because your urine is concentrated in the morning with the highest levels of hCG. Do not drink fluids before collecting the urine as it can dilute the hCG levels and alter the results.

**4. Collecting the urine sample:**

Some home pregnancy kits require you to hold an indicator stick under the urine stream until it soaks completely. This will take about three to five seconds. Some other urine testing kits will require the urine sample to be collected in a cup and test a few drops on the stick.

**5. Read the instructions carefully:**
Before taking the test, go through the instructions given in the overleaf. Different brands have different specifications, and you need to understand the one you are about to use.

Factors such as the method of collecting the urine, the length of the time you need to let the urine stay on the test stick and the symbols used to prove the results could be different for each brand.

**6. Familiarize yourself with the symbols:**

You have to know the symbols listed on your pack to understand the reading better. If you are unable to decipher the symbols when reading the results, do not panic. Call the toll free number listed on the pack to seek help.

**7. Wait for the results:**
After the test, place the strip horizontally on a clean surface for the readings. Different tests have different time requirements. The waiting time is usually anywhere from one to five minutes but some tests are said to take as long as ten minutes to give the correct result.
Dispose of the strip after the result is out. Do not consider the result if it takes too long to come out. The results may be inaccurate and can give a false positive evaporation line.

**8. Checking the final result:**

If you see even a faint line appearing next to the first one, consider that as a positive. This indicates that the test had picked up traces of hCG in your urine.
If you are not sure about the line, which is too light and not definitive, wait until the following morning for a retest.

### After the result, here are some things you need to keep in mind:

**1. In the case of a positive result:**

If a urine pregnancy test result is positive, make an appointment with your doctor. Your specialist may also recommend a blood test to confirm the results of the urine test. In most cases, the results of a urine test are accurate.

**2. In the case of a negative result:**

If you have missed your period and still the result shows negative, wait for some more time and take the test again. False negatives are sometimes possible. These can happen when you have miscalculated your ovulation date or taken the test earlier than recommended.

### How Accurate Are Home Pregnancy Tests?

Home pregnancy tests claim to be 97% to 99% accurate if they are done in the right way. However, in certain cases, as discussed below, the result could be false positive or false negative.

If you continue to get false results in spite of the symptoms of pregnancy such as missed period, nausea, fatigue and breast tenderness, wait to take another test or check with your doctor.

 
### Reason For A False Positive:
Although false positives are rare after a urine test they are not ruled out. A false positive result is nothing but the test proving that you are pregnant, while in reality, you are not. 


### Reasons For A False Negative:
If the test indicates a negative again and again, do not worry. False negatives are common. See a doctor to find out the reason for your missed period.

False negatives can happen due to several reasons, some of which are listed below:

**1. Testing too early:**

If you undertake a pregnancy test in a sheer rush of anxiety, be prepared for a false negative. You have to wait until it is time to take the test. The chances of getting a false negative are high if you take the test immediately after missing your period.

**2. Low sensitivity of the strip:**

Despite picking the latest pregnancy kit, there is every chance of your strip being less sensitive while detecting the level of hCG due to a manufacturing defect. If you are not convinced with the negative result, try and retake the test with a different brand of home pregnancy kit.

**3. Diluted urine:**

This is the very reason why you should take the test early in the morning. If it is taken at other times of the day, the diluted urine might give a misleading result. Sometimes, your early morning urine could also be diluted. In that case, take the test again on the next day. The results could be different.

Even if the test is negative, we suggest you be positive and have a word with your doctor.

Once your pregnancy is confirmed, you will have to undergo urine tests at various times during the nine months. This time it will not be at home but at a clinic or lab.

### Clinical Urine Test (Urinalysis) At Doctorâ€™s Clinic:
Your doctor will recommend a urine test during the first prenatal care visit to confirm the result of the home test and also to rule out any health issues that could pose a danger to your pregnancy. You will continue to have periodic tests during the prenatal appointments.
