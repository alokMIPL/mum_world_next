This Sweet Potato Mac and Cheese requires just 5 simple ingredients, zero prep work, and is just the yummiest pasta recipe! 

### You will need:

- Pasta: We prefer a small pasta shape, but any will work.

- Sweet potato puree: You can use a pouch or homemade puree.

- Unsalted butter 

- Shredded cheddar cheese: This melts right into the mixture, making it super creamy without the need to make a roux. 

- Milk

### How to Prepare:

- Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain. 

- Measure out the sweet potato. (This is a great step for the kids to help with!) 

- Add all of the ingredients to the pot. 

- Stir together.
